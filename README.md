# StacsYak

## Introduction
StacsYak is a online new messaging service. It lets the users post messages, called Yaks, to a service and read the Yaks other people post.

The StacsYak system is based around a server-side Web API that can be used to post Yaks, read all the current Yaks, and delete Yaks. It can also be used to up vote and down vote
Yaks, and get information about the users of the system, though these are provided for the
basis of extension activities.
